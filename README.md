# Customer Order & Revenue Analysis (Synthetic Data)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** using **AI-generated synthetic e-commerce transactional data**.  
The goal of the project is to **experiment with customer order and revenue analysis**, apply real-world analytical techniques, and showcase how business insights can be derived from transactional datasets.

Since the associated e-commerce website has no active users, the dataset used in this project is **synthetic** and generated to resemble realistic order data for learning and experimentation purposes.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Practice data cleaning and feature engineering on transactional data  
- Analyze revenue distribution and product performance using SQL  
- Explore customer demographics and geographic purchasing patterns  
- Build interactive dashboards for insight communication  
- Demonstrate an end-to-end analytics pipeline from application → database → reporting

## 📊 Analytical Workflow
1. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Generated AI-based transactional data resembling e-commerce orders
   - Captured customer demographics, product details, and order values

2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Python)**
   - Handled missing values
   - Standardized categorical fields (gender, city, state)
   - Engineered age groups
   - Calculated net revenue using business formulas

3. **Data Analysis (PostgreSQL)**
   - Stored cleaned data in relational tables
   - Executed SQL queries to:
     - Calculate total and category-wise revenue
     - Identify low-performing products
     - Analyze demographic and geographic trends

4. **Visualization (Power BI)**
   - Built an interactive dashboard covering:
     - Sales & Revenue Distribution
     - Product and Category Performance
     - Customer Demographics and Geography

5. **Application-Level Integration**
   - Built a Next.js e-commerce platform to generate test transactional data
   - Designed PostgreSQL schema to support analytics workflows
